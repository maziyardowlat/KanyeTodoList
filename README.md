# DSPD- Dynamic Student Daily Planner 

## A daily scheduler for the dynamic and ever-changing plans of Student with Grade Keeping Capabilities

This is a daily planner that is tailored specifically for the **Student**, as this todo-list allows students to have multiple lists open at once.
The main reason why this idea came to be is that I make daily todo lists, but often times miss one step and feel demotivated and will end up re-writing a brand new one from scratch, and this wastes paper.
Therefore, DSPD is the perfect solution for the problem as it allows for the student to view their original plan, and if they make a mistake, they can have both of their lists that can be viewed simultaneously.

Another feature that will be present in this daily planner is the incorporation of a ***Grades*** Tab, where Students can select from a variety of courses, and they can input in their current grades
and the grade that they want to finish the course with. This functions similar to the todo-list, as while this is not a daily task that can be completed like the rest, this will be a work-in-progress
achievement. Various sources have stated that writing down a specific goal will lead to a higher chance of completion, and this is something that I utilize in my daily life as well. Alongside the ability to input in grades, the user will have the ability to make notes
that are specific to the course, and this can allow them to write down a plan, or simply just notes with regards to the course.
While both of these features can be completed by Frankenstein-ing pieces of paper together, the ability to view all the information in one place is the real reason why I am going for this project.
I actively use lists, as well as keeping track of my grades in an excel document, but having the ability to view my original plan alongside of having my grades and information about them available is the main
draw of this app.
